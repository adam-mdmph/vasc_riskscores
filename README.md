# VasCalc

This shiny app is a collaborative effort to aggregate peer-reviewed, publicly available risk models into an interface for busy, active vascular surgeon.  VasCalc is a decision aide and is not intended to supersede clinician or patient preference.  

All models are wrong but some are useful.
